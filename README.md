## Project Learning

On this project I put myself on a challenge to practice my knowledge that i acquired from the last project, Gym Pass API. I think that i need to improve a lot about some points like JWT and code tests possibilities. Although I could to improve during the whole process development.
I used also Insomnia to simulate a client making some requests to back-end.
